* Microphone
** Physical principles
We have used a capacitive microphone. It is built up by a diaphragm that detects the sound waves. The movement of the diaphragm causes the two plates in the capacitor to move, and thereby varying the capacitance, because the capacitance is inversely proportional with the distance between the two plates.

** Multisim circuit schematics
Extension of microphone schematic with added filters. Made filters twice, first to see effects of each filter seperately, then to see the overall effect of both filters on the circuit.

* Digital controller
** Function description
In our circuit, we use the reference voltage for both the oscillator, the microphone with filter and the piano. To control which of these that sends their output to the loudspeaker, we have implemented a digital control. The control consists of two flip flops and a multiplexer. It has four channels, each with a light. The button gives signal when pushed and a push will change the signal.

** Waveform diagram

* LM555 piano
** Description
Depending on which button that is pressed, the resistance will vary. The change in resistance also changes the frequency with the relation
\[
f = \frac{1.44}{(R1+R2)\cdot C1}.
\]
Because the resistance is inversely proportional with the frequency, a higher resistance equals a lower frequency.
